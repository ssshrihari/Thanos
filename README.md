ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Shrihari! I'm a passionate and dedicated Software Engineer with proficiency in Java, Python, and a multitude of AWS services.

I've spent the past few years honing my skills and contributing to a variety of projects, from scalable web development to robust microservice architectures. 

I have a strong focus on building efficient, scalable, and fault-tolerant systems. 

I'm always excited to collaborate on projects and eager to learn more.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest tech trends or immersed in a good book. 

Let's connect and build something great together!
